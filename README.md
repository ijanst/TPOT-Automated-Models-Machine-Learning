# TPOT-Automated-Models-Machine-Learning
TPOT, through genetic algorithms, simplifies the traditional and time-consuming process of building machine learning models, which typically involves intensive experimentation, parameter tuning, and technique selection. This automation facilitates optimal feature-model-parameter combinations, to focus more on results than experiments.
